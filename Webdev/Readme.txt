⚙️ **Template Directory**
All HTML templates are now organized under the `templates/` folder. Legacy or unused layouts have been moved to `templates/archive/` and the 404 error page resides in `templates/errors/`.
Template filenames no longer include the `_v2` suffix and `base_v2.html` has been renamed to `base.html`. Update any custom routes or render calls accordingly.
